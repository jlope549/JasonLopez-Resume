        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a current student at the University of California, Riverside, I am developing knowledge to better prepare for my future career. I am interested in the world of business and would like to help companies improve in the future. At the moment, I am focusing on my studies and working part-time. I have no internship experience but would like to gain an opportunity someday. 
	When I was in high school, I took an interest in cell, molecular, and developmental biology. I was especially interested in cancer cells. There are different kinds of cancers. How do they develop? Where do they develop? Is there a way to stop the process, or at least slow the process? What do researchers of cancer cells know already? What are cell biology researchers looking for right now? The world of cells is truly amazing. After all, cells are the basic building blocks of all living things.
<br><br>

        However, a turn in my studies took over when I had to take a break from school because I couldnâ€™t afford it. I could not afford to commute to Riverside, and the rent was too much for me. I had to take a year off, and I watched as my colleagues continued their studies. I dreamed about attending UCR, and I did not want to transfer. I wanted to meet the amazing professors and have the opportunity to learn from them. I was so focused on what I wanted to study, and not what I needed to study. I was so focused on my studies that I had not noticed how much my family struggled financially. This built a need and desire to study business administration. 
	I learned to develop a good work ethic. I work as a customer service representative for a gas station, and I am making the minimum wage. This is a job that anyone can do. However, not everyone wants to do this job. In the afternoon shift, I am seen helping 500 people. Sometimes people can give me a hard time, and I develop patience. Sometimes, I work double shifts when no one wants to work at night. On the night shift, I am seen sweeping outside and taking out the trash near the gas pumps, etc. I do everything quickly so that I can go inside the store and lock it. It can be dangerous outside at night. No one wants to make minimum wage and handle the stress. It is just not worth it. But, if your dreams are big, I believe you can handle anything. Just take a deep breath and get back to work. I am just extremely grateful for having a job and being able to afford my meals. 
<br><br>

        	I learned the importance of budget and expenses. I was denied from getting a car because of a lack of credit and the lack of money I saved up. I learned the importance of credit and savings. I was denied a rental place because I needed to make three times the monthly rent per month and have good credit. I learned that I needed to build a good career and credit score. 	For now, I am in the learning process of business administration. Hopefully, I will build experience with an internship.
